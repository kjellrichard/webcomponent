# Example of HTML Web Component #
This example demonstrates an application that incorporates two web components: a header and a navigation component.

The setup involves two separate servers: one dedicated to serving the application and the other to serving the components. These servers operate on different ports to ensure smooth functionality.

To install the necessary dependencies, execute the following command:
```sh
npm install
```

To launch the application, simply run:
```sh
npm start
```
